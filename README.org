** ESP-WiFi-LEDs
  Work in progress.
  
  A device that shines pretty RGB lights based on WiFi traffic around it.
  Shows a rainbow animation on startup.

  [Here is a video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unmanbearpig/esp8266-ws2812-wifi-sniff/master/amazing.mov)

  Hardware needed:
  - An ESP8266 dev board. I've used ESP-01. Because I could get it locally for cheap, but something like NodeMCU or D1 Mini must be easier to work with if you can spare some physical space.
  - Some WS2812 LEDs, don't forget to specify the number of them in the source code. I use 8 by default.
  - Logic level converter to make them talk to each other. WS2812 kinda sorta work at 3.3 work but they are so flickery at that voltage that you better power them from 5V and use a level converter.
  - 3.3V regulator


** TODO Improvements
*** TODO Control brightness?
*** TODO Add channel selector
**** Use LEDs to show selected channel
**** Add channel hopping mode
*** TODO Lower the brightness of old devices, so the new ones flash brightly
*** TODO Signal level doesn't affect brightness as much as I'd like
*** Use destination MAC as well
*** MACs
**** TODO Make sure the color is actually based on manufacturer MACs
**** TODO Make it so similar manufacturer MACs have similar color
*** TODO Different modes
**** Color based on type of device (base station, client, something else?)
**** Color based on type of packet
*** Hardware
**** Power
     At 8 WS2812 LEDs
     and 5V (to power LEDs)
     80-150 mA, average probably around 100-110
**** TODO Add brightness dial?
**** TODO Make it smaller
**** TODO Make a case for it
***** Requirements
****** Has to have a light diffuser
****** Openable to change/replace things
****** USB plug?
**** TODO Power via battery, USB, or both?
** TODO Challenge
   Find a spot without a single WiFi device.
